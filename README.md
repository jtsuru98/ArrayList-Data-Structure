# ArrayList-Data-Structure
I am using this file to learn basic Git functionality and learn more about data structures.
ArrayList is built using an array and primitive data types. It includes basic List methods

Stack and Queue contain their appropiate methods, and also implemented garbage collection to keep memory efficient.
